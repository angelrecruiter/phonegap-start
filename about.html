   <h2>ABOUT OUR LENS'S WE USE AND LOVE</h2>
       
  <p> 40 years ago when I was just a 15 year old looking through my dads slides, I realised this is what I wanted to do. Not realising that this would be the top of my personal rainbow.</p>
           
  <p>Now I have a countless number of cameras and lenses and love to just play with their different sizes and the things each intervidual can do.</p>
  
<p> My favorite is the <strong>200/500 zoom, telephoto lens</strong>. Thats the one I can do just about anything with. From Surfing, a wild eagle and a mountain revine. Spectacular, crisp and soft, at the same time. </p> 
          
  <p> My camera and lens choices are relatively simple. “Through running workshops I have used a vast range of camera brands and truly believe you can make any equipment work for you”. </p>

<p>“Shooting landscapes and selling prints, two things I am after in my gear is high resolution and high dynamic range. At this point in time I am shooting Nikon and Pentax, which I have for the past two years. I still think Nikon make some of the best lenses, but occasionally I do miss the rugged feel of a DSLR over mirrorless”.</p>


<p>“I've never shot composites either. My camera can handle a large dynamic range, but if it's too high I will manually shoot two separate exposures back to back and blend later. But really there's nothing more rewarding than seeing the final image on the back of your camera,”. “I've returned to some locations a ridiculous number of times over the years. It's all about the thrill of the chase and nothing compares to that moment when everything aligns, it's truly special.”</p>
