       <h3>Works like a dream</h3>
	 
 <p>Thanks a lot! Having followed your step-by-step instructions, I see that everything works again as it is supposed to do. 
My own collection of 7’200 LPs and CDs is well displayed on iMac, iPad and iPhone. Synchronisation via CLZ Cloud works like a dream. 
I appreciate your very efficient and truly very quick customer support, and all the more considering that you are the owner/boss of CLZ and still take your time to help your old customers (in my case: old in life years and in customer years). CLZ is extraordinary – that’s not taken to be granted in today’s digital world. 
Kind regards – and greetings to your Team and to the beautiful town of Amsterdam that I have visited several times in the last 30+ years.  — Urs Mühlemann (Switzerland) on Music Collector

<p>Quite comprehensive
 I am a new user to this program and have found it quite comprehensive already. I purchased it after it was able to find the first three vinyl albums I put into the trial program (and I purposefully picked obscure albums). Well done, thank you.  — Larry Herrett (USA) on Music Collector
 August 07, 2017</p>
<p>Convinced
 I had been looking for a solution to catalog my LP collection from my college days. Your software was mentioned in the Roon forums as well as another I visit. 
Besides my many mainstream releases some of my LPs are rather obscure or regional releases. The first three regional release LPs I entered into the trial popped right up however. I was convinced and paid for it immediately. $28 is quite a deal for this functionality. Thanks!  — Larry Herrett (USA) on Music Collector

<p>Finally I am organized!
 I have been using CLZ for a few years and when the app came out I picked it up immediately. With over 1000 albums and CDs I found it impossible to track what I had. Buying double items was a frequent event. Now I know what I have and even better, can track down to a specific track or song. This system is fantastic.  — Only Snicketts on CLZ Music

<p>Great
 Fantastic program. At last I have catalogued all my LPs. 
Great help from Collectorz when I needed it also.  — ‎Mark Irvin‎ (Australia) on Music Collector

<p>Great product for personal collections
 My partner and I are vinyl collectors. We have cataloged over a thousand titles. I love the flexibility of creating some of your own field headers, and setting some default fields to auto-populate. I do cataloging for a major academic library and this is a great product for personal collections.  — Christopher Mixon on CLZ Music

<p>Great for collectors!
 This app really has all you need to keep up with your collection and really keeps me from duplicating purchases.  — Musiccollectin_moe on CLZ Music

<p>Works perfectly
 WJMX-DB Smooth Jazz Boston Global Radio recommends this world-class music database solution. We use it everyday to catalog our music database for the station and it is truly amazing and easy to use. GRAB it now! </p>
Highly recommended no matter if you have a music business or a personal collection. It will not only meet but also exceed your expectations of a music database solution. We use it with our barcode scanner equipment to scan or manually enter single or full albums. Works perfectly either way.  — Jeff Moses (USA) on Music Collector</p>
